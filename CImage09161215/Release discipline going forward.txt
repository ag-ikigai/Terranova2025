Release discipline going forward

Freeze each module’s outputs schema in a <module>_contract.md.

Gate merges with: (1) unit tests, (2) smoke tests, and (3) contract validator.

Package modules as code (not zips); tag a Git commit when smoke is green.

Do not change artifact filenames without updating the contract + M5 mappings.


Plan for M6–M9

Coding Agent produces small, isolated functions per spec.

Coding Auditor checks against the contracts and smoke tests.

We package the module end‑to‑end in the repo, add tests, then cut a release tag.
